## ðŸš€ What Is AJAX?

**AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)** is a web development technique that allows web applications to send and retrieve data from a Web server **asynchronously** without needing to refresh or reload the entire webpage. This results in faster, more dynamic, and **interactive** user experiences, as only **specific parts** of the webpage can be updated based on the user's actions.  

AJAX is **not** a programming language or a tool but a concept that combines several technologies to create efficient and dynamic web applications.  

Traditionally, the <LinkOut href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest'>XMLHttpRequest</LinkOut> object was used to achieve this, but in modern web development, the <LinkOut href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API'>Fecth API</LinkOut>
**Fetch API** has largely replaced XMLHttpRequest due to its simplicity and flexibility.
