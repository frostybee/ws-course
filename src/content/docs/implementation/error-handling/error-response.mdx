## Motivation
---

:::note
- A consistent **structure for error responses** makes it easier for developers to understand and handle errors across different API endpoints. When the **structure is predictable**, developers can quickly identify what went wrong and how to process the error.
- When the error response is **structured properly** (including status codes, error codes, and meaningful messages), it helps both developers and systems easily pinpoint the problem during debugging.
:::


## Key Principles
--- 

1. **Use appropriate HTTP status codes**: The status code should reflect the type of error (e.g., `400` for bad requests, `404` for not found, `500` for server errors).
2. **Consistent Format:** Keep the error response format consistent with your successful responses (e.g., JSON), so clients can parse it uniformly.
3. **Provide enough detail**: Include a human-readable message, an error code (if applicable), and optionally, details for debugging or next steps.
4. **Avoid overexposure:** Don't leak sensitive information (e.g., stack traces) in production responses.

## Recommended Structure
---

To **properly structure** a REST API response with an error message, you should follow a **standard format** that makes the response easy to understand and consistent. 
:::tip
**Don't Include Sensitive Information**: Avoid including sensitive information such as database internals, stack traces, or detailed logs in the error response.

### **HTTP Status Code**  
---

- Use the appropriate HTTP **status code** for the error. This helps clients quickly understand the type of issue:
    - **4xx**: Client-related errors (e.g., invalid input, not found).
    - **5xx**: Server-related errors (e.g., internal server issues).
- **Example status codes**:
    - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid or missing parameters.
    - `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failure.     
    - `403 Forbidden`: Authentication succeeded, but the user doesn't have permission.
    - `404 Not Found`: Resource is not found.
    - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server encountered an unexpected condition.

### **Response Format**  
---

Keep the error response format consistent with your successful responses (e.g., JSON), so clients can parse it uniformly.

A well-structured error response typically includes:
- **status**: Indicates the outcome (e.g., "error" or "fail").
- **message**: A concise, human-readable description of the error.
- **code** (optional): A machine-readable error code for programmatic handling.
- **details** (optional): Additional context, such as validation errors or specific fields that failed.
   
### Example of a Structured Error Response

Here's a sample response for an error when a user tries to access a resource that doesn't exist:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Bad Request: Missing required parameter 'email'.",
  "details": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "issue": "Missing"
    }
  ],
  "documentation_url": "https://example.com/api/docs/errors#400"
}
```
