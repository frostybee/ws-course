## Motivation
---

:::note
- A consistent **structure for error responses** makes it easier for developers to understand and handle errors across different API endpoints. When the **structure is predictable**, developers can quickly identify what went wrong and how to process the error.
- When the error response is structured properly (including status codes, error codes, and meaningful messages), it helps both developers and systems easily pinpoint the problem during debugging.
:::

## Producing a Well-Structured Error Response
---

To **properly structure** a REST API response with an error message, you should follow a **standard format** that makes the response easy to understand and consistent. This ensures that your API responses with error messages are **easy to interpret** and handle, improving the client experience and **easing debugging**.

:::tip
**Don't Include Sensitive Information**: Avoid including sensitive information such as database internals, stack traces, or detailed logs in the error response.
:::

### **HTTP Status Code**  
---

- Use the appropriate HTTP **status code** for the error. This helps clients quickly understand the type of issue:
    - **4xx**: Client-related errors (e.g., invalid input, not found).
    - **5xx**: Server-related errors (e.g., internal server issues).
- **Example status codes**:
    - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid or missing parameters.
    - `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failure.     
    - `403 Forbidden`: Authentication succeeded, but the user doesn't have permission.
    - `404 Not Found`: Resource is not found.
    - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server encountered an unexpected condition.

### **Response Format**  
---

The response body should be structured as a JSON object with the following key properties:
- **status**: General status of the response (e.g., error, success).
- **code**: HTTP status code indicating the type of error.
- **message**: A human-readable message explaining the error. Ensure the message is concise, informative, and written in plain language.
- **details**: The `details` field is optional, but it can be useful for providing further context on validation issues (e.g., missing required fields, or invalid format).
- **documentation_url**: A link to the documentation to help developers troubleshoot the issue.
- **Consistency**: Be consistent in the error structure across different endpoints of your API.
   
### Example of a Structured Error Response

Here's a sample response for an error when a user tries to access a resource that doesn't exist:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Bad Request: Missing required parameter 'email'.",
  "details": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "issue": "Missing"
    }
  ],
  "documentation_url": "https://example.com/api/docs/errors#400"
}
```
