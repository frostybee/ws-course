## 🔔 Why Input Validation Matters?
---
:::note
1. **Security**: Prevents **malicious data** from compromising your application (e.g., injection attacks).
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensures inputs **match expected** types, formats, and constraints (e.g., email format, non-negative numbers).
3. **User Experience**: Provides clear **error messages** to API consumers when inputs are invalid.
4. **Reliability & Stability**: Prevents crashes, runtime errors, or unexpected behavior due to malformed data.

## 👩‍💻 What to Validate?
---
### 🔢 Input Sources
For a REST API, inputs typically come from:
- **Query Parameters** (e.g., `GET /species?limit=10`)
- **URL Path Parameters** (e.g., `GET /players/123`)
- **Request Body** (e.g., JSON in a POST or PUT request)
- **Headers** (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Authorization`)

### 📋 Validation Rules
You'll need to validate:
- **Presence**: Is a required field provided?
- **Type**: Is the input an integer, string, boolean, etc.?
- **Format**: Does it match a pattern (e.g., email, date)?
- **Range/Length**: Is it within acceptable bounds (e.g., age between 18-100)?
- **Business Rules**: Does it make sense in your domain (e.g., order quantity > 0)?

## 🔨 Tools and Approaches in PHP

1. **Native PHP Functions**:
   - `filter_var()` for sanitizing and validating common types (e.g., email, URL).
   - `isset()`, `empty()` for checking presence.
   - Type casting/checking with `is_int()`, `is_string()`, etc.

2. **Third-Party Libraries**: **[Valitron](https://github.com/vlucas/valitron)**: A simple, stand-alone validation library with no dependencies.
