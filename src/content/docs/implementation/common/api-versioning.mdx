## What is REST API Versioning?

API versioning allows you to make changes to your API without breaking existing clients. Clients using `v1` continue to work while you develop new features in `v2`.

We'll use **URI versioning**, the most straightforward approach where the version is part of the URI path.

## Steps to Version Your REST API

:::caution[Important]
1. Only **one team member** should perform the versioning setup to avoid merge conflicts or duplicated work.
2. Do not copy the `.git` folder into `v1` or `v2`. Keep the `.git` folder in the root of your web service (aka your slim application).
:::

1. Create two subdirectories in your web service's root folder: `v1` and `v2`.

2. Copy all files from your root web service folder into both `v1` and `v2`.

3. Clients can now call a particular API version using the versioned base URI:
   - `localhost/species-api/v1`
   - `localhost/species-api/v2`

4. Commit and push all updates to GitHub remote repository.

And that's it! Your REST API now supports multiple versions via URI versioning.
