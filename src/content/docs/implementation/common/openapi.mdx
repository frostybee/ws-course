## What is OpenAPI?

- OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) is a specification **for describing** REST APIs. 
- It's like a blueprint that tells developers exactly how your API works: what endpoints are available, what data they expect, and what they return. 
- Think of it as a user manual for your API that both humans and computers can understand.
- OpenAPI specifications are written in **YAML** (or JSON) format and follow a specific structure. YAML is human-readable and uses indentation to represent hierarchy, making it ideal for API documentation.

## Development & Quality Checklist

### Getting Started (First-time creation)
- [ ] Define your API's basic info (title, version, description).
- [ ] List your server URIs.
- [ ] Document at least one GET endpoint.
- [ ] Create schemas for your main data models.
- [ ] Add request/response examples.
- [ ] Test your specification in Swagger Editor.

### Quality Assurance (Before submission)
- [ ] All endpoints have clear descriptions and examples.
- [ ] Every response code is documented with appropriate schemas.
- [ ] Data models are complete with proper types and validations.
- [ ] Authentication requirements are clearly specified.
- [ ] File validates without errors in VS Code extension.
- [ ] Specification renders properly in OpenAPI Playground. 
- [ ] Examples are realistic and helpful for implementation.
- [ ] Error responses include meaningful error messages.
- [ ] Generate documentation to share with others.
---

### Naming Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive names for endpoints and parameters.
- Follow RESTful naming (nouns for resources, verbs for actions).
- Use consistent casing (camelCase for properties, kebab-case for paths)

### Documentation Quality
- Write clear, concise descriptions for every element.
- Include realistic examples in requests and responses.
- Explain what each status code means in context.
- Document error scenarios and their causes.
---

## Progressive Development Strategy

1. **Start simple:** Begin with basic info and one or two endpoints.
2. **Add gradually:** Expand endpoints one at a time.
3. **Test frequently:** Validate after each major addition.
4. **Refine and polish:** Add examples and improve descriptions.
5. **Final review:** Check completeness and consistency.

---

## Success Tips

- **Plan before writing:** Sketch out your API structure first.  
- **Use references:** Study well-documented APIs for inspiration.
- **Iterate often:** Don't try to perfect everything in one pass.
- **Get feedback:** Have peers review your specification.
- **Think like a user:** Write documentation that helps someone implement your API

---

## Basic YAML Syntax Rules
- **Indentation matters:** Use 2 spaces (not tabs) for each level.  
- **Key-value pairs:** `key: value`
- **Lists:** Use hyphens (`-`) for array items.
- **Strings:** Can be quoted or unquoted (quote when containing special characters).
- **Comments:** Start with `#`

## OpenAPI File Structure Overview

Every OpenAPI specification follows this basic structure:

```yaml
openapi: 3.2.0
info:
  # Basic API information
servers:
  # Server configurations
paths:
  # API endpoints
components:
  # Reusable components
```

---

## Example of a Basic Structure of an OpenAPI File

An OpenAPI specification is written in YAML or JSON format. Here's the basic structure:

```yaml
openapi: 3.2.0
info:
  title: My Planets API
  description: A simple API for managing planetary data
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  - url: https://api.space-research.com/v1
    description: Production server
paths:
  /planets:
    get:
      summary: Get all planets
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Planet'
components:
  schemas:
    Planet:
      type: object
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - system
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
          example: 1
        name:
          type: string
          example: "Earth"
        system:
          type: string
          example: "Solar System"
```

          description: Planet not found
```
---

### 4. Components Section (Reusable Schemas)
```yaml

  schemas:
    Planet:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer

          type: string
        system:
          type: string
```
---

## Step-by-Step Creation Process

### Step 1: Document Header and Info Section
Start with the OpenAPI version and basic information about your API:
- **Version:** Always specify OpenAPI 3.0.3 or higher.  
- **Title:** Clear, descriptive name for your API.
- **Description:** Brief overview of what your API does.
- **Version:** Your API's version (use semantic versioning like 1.0.0).
- **Contact:** Optional contact information.

### Step 2: Define Servers
Specify where your API will be hosted:
- **Development server:** Local development URI.
- **Production server:** Live deployment URI.
- **Description:** Brief note about each server's purpose.

---

### Step 3: Create Path Definitions
This is the core of your specification. For each endpoint:

**Path Structure:**
- Start with the URI path (e.g., `/planets`, `/planets/{id}`)
- Define HTTP methods (get, post, put, delete, etc.).
- Add descriptions and summaries.   

**Parameters:**
- **Path parameters:** Variables in the URI (like `{id}`)
- **Query parameters:** Optional filters or pagination.
- **Request body:** For POST/PUT operations.

**Responses:**
- Define all possible HTTP status codes.
- Specify response content types.
- Include example responses.

---

### Step 4: Define Data Models (Schemas)
Create reusable data structures in the components section:
- **Object properties:** Define each field with type and description
- **Required fields:** Specify which fields are mandatory.
- **Data types:** Use standard types (string, integer, boolean, array, object).
- **Validation rules:** Add constraints like minimum/maximum values.

### Step 5: Add Security Schemes (If Needed)
Define authentication methods:
- **API Keys:** For simple token-based auth.
- **Bearer tokens:** For JWT or OAuth.
- **Basic auth:** For username/password authentication.

## Common HTTP Methods in OpenAPI

### GET - Retrieve Data
```yaml
/books:
  get:
    summary: Get all books
    parameters:
      - name: limit
        in: query
        schema:
          type: integer
          default: 10
```

---

### POST - Create New Resource
```yaml
/books:
  post:
    summary: Create a new book
    requestBody:
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Book'
```
---

### PUT - Update Entire Resource
```yaml
/books/{id}:
  put:
    summary: Update a book
    parameters:
      - name: id
        in: path
        required: true
        schema:
          type: integer
```

---

### DELETE - Remove Resource
```yaml
/books/{id}:
  delete:
    summary: Delete a book
    parameters:
      - name: id
        in: path
        required: true
        schema:
          type: integer
```

---

## Data Types and Validation

OpenAPI supports various data types with validation rules:

```yaml
properties:
  age:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 150
  email:
    type: string
    format: email
  website:
    type: string
    format: uri
  birthDate:
    type: string
    format: date
  rating:
    type: number
    minimum: 1.0
    maximum: 5.0
  tags:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
```
---

## Authentication in OpenAPI

### API Key Authentication
```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X-API-Key

security:
  - ApiKeyAuth: []
```
---

### Bearer Token (JWT)
```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
```
---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### YAML Formatting Issues
- **Inconsistent indentation:** Always use 2 spaces.
- **Missing colons:** Every key needs a colon.
- **Incorrect list formatting:** Use proper hyphen alignment.

### Content Problems
- **Missing required fields:** Always mark required fields in your schemas.
- **Inconsistent data types:** Use the same type for the same data across endpoints.    
- **Missing examples:** Always provide realistic examples.
- **Incomplete error handling:** Document all possible error scenarios.
- **Vague descriptions:** Write clear, specific descriptions for endpoints and parameters.
- **Ignoring status codes:** Document all possible HTTP response codes.

### Design Issues
- **Non-RESTful patterns:** Follow REST principles for consistency.
- **Overly complex schemas:** Keep data models simple and focused.  
- **Missing versioning:** Always include API version information.
- **Inconsistent naming:** Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase or snake_case).
