## What Are Sub-Collections in a REST API?
- In REST API design, resources are typically organized **hierarchically**.
- A **sub-collection** typically represents a **nested resource** under a **parent resource** (e.g., `/players/{player_id}/goals` goals scored by a specific player).  

:::note
- The JSON response for **a sub-collection** should represent the **parent-child** relationship clearly, provide the necessary data about the sub-collection items, and often include **metadata** for context, pagination, or navigation (with links).

## Components of a Sub-Collection JSON Response

A well-structured JSON response for **a sub-collection** typically **includes**:
1. **Parent context**: Details about the parent resource for clarity, if relevant. Optional but recommended. This reinforces the **hierarchical relationship** and can reduce the need for additional requests.
2. **The sub-collection data**: An array of items representing the sub-collection.
3. **Pagination metadata**: Information about the sub-collection, such as total count, pagination details, or filters applied.
4. **Links**: Hypermedia links (optional but recommended) for navigation (e.g., to the parent resource or next page).

---

## Guidelines for Sub-Collection Responses
1. **Use plural keys for collections**: Name the endpoint and array to reflect the collection (e.g., `players`, not `player`).
2. **Use descriptive keys**: Name the sub-collection clearly (e.g., `"goals"` instead of just `"data"` if it adds context).
3. **Embed parent context**: Include parent details only if necessary.
4. **Support pagination**: For large sub-collections, add pagination metadata (e.g., `page`, `limit`, `total`).
5. **Use standard HTTP status codes**: Return 200 for success, 404 if the parent resource isn't found, etc.
6. **Follow a naming convention**: Stick to camelCase, snake_case, or kebab-case based on your API's style.
7. **Error handling**: If the sub-collection is empty, return an empty array (`"data": []`) rather than `null` or an error (unless the parent resource doesn't exist, which might result in a 404 case).

## How to Produce a Sub-Collection Response?
Below is a `model method` that demonstrates an implementation of properly structured response of a READ operation on a sub-collection. 
- **Endpoint:** `GET /players/{player_id}/goals`
- **Description:** Get the goals scored by a specific player.


```php title="Example: Producing a structure response for a sub-collection with parent resource context"
// This method was implemented in the PlayersModel class.  
public function getGoalsByPlayerID(string $player_id): mixed
{
    // 1) Fetch the details of the player parent resource.
    $player = $this->getPlayerById($player_id);
  
    //NOTE: The content of the PHP heredoc must be properly indented.
    // @see: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.heredoc
    $goals_query = <<<SQL
        SELECT * FROM goals g, tournaments t,
        matches m
        WHERE g.tournament_id = t.tournament_id
        AND g.match_id = m.match_id
        AND player_id = :player_id
    SQL;

    // 2) Fetch the items of the goals sub-collection along with the tournament and match info.
    $goals = $this->paginate(
        $goals_query,
        ["player_id" => $player_id]
    );
    // 3) Produce a well structured response for the goals sub-collection.
    $results = [
        "player" => $player,
        "meta" => $goals["meta"],
        "goals" => $goals["data"],
    ];

    return $results;
}
```

## Examples: Sub-Collection Responses

### Empty Sub-Collection
- Endpoint: `GET /players/{player_id}/goals`
- URI: `GET /players/P-00020/goals`

```json title="Example: Structure of an empty sub-collection response with parent resource context"
{  
  "player": {...}, // Parent resource context
  "meta": {        // Sub-collection pagination metadata
    "total_items": 0,
    "offset": 0,
    "current_page": 1,
    "page_size": 5,
    "total_pages": 0
  },
  "goals": []      // Sub-collection data items
}
```
- Empty array indicates no goals.
- **Returns 200 status (assuming the player exists).**

---

### Example: Sub-Collection with Parent Context
- Endpoint: `GET /players/{player_id}/goals`
- URI: `GET /players/P-28154/goals`

**Note:**
- `"player"` provides context about the parent resource.
- `"goals"` is the sub-collection (named specifically instead of `"data"`) and contains the data items.

```json title="Example: Structure of a sub-collection response with parent resource context"

  "player": {        // Parent resource context
