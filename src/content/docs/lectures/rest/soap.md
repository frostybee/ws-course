SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) web services offer several benefits that make them a popular choice in certain scenarios:

:::note
The following **benefits** make **SOAP** Web services a good choice for enterprise-level applications, especially when dealing with complex transactions, high-security requirements, and formal contract definitions. However, it's also worth noting that **RESTful** Web services have become popular for their *simplicity* and *efficiency*, particularly in Web and mobile applications.
:::

1. **Standardization**: SOAP is a well-defined protocol with a comprehensive set of standards. It follows strict rules for message structure, making it easier to ensure interoperability between different systems.

2. **Language and Platform Agnostic**: SOAP Web services can be used with any programming language and on any platform. The protocol itself is independent of the underlying operating system or programming language.

3. **Extensive Specification**: SOAP includes a detailed specification for how messages should be formatted and processed. This can include additional features such as security (WS-Security), transactions (WS-AtomicTransaction), and messaging reliability (WS-ReliableMessaging).

4. **Built-in Error Handling**: SOAP provides a standard way to handle errors through its fault element, which helps in managing exceptions and providing error messages in a structured manner.

5. **Security**: SOAP supports various security standards and protocols, such as WS-Security, which allows for message-level security, including encryption and digital signatures.

6. **Formal Contract**: SOAP services use WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to describe the available functions, parameters, and data types. This formal contract can be used to generate client-side code and ensures that both the service provider and consumer have a clear understanding of how to interact.

7. **Transaction Management**: SOAP can support complex transactions with the help of standards like WS-AtomicTransaction, making it suitable for applications that require strict transactional integrity.

8. **Reliability**: With standards such as WS-ReliableMessaging, SOAP Web services can ensure that messages are delivered reliably, even in cases of network failures or disruptions.

9. **Extensibility**: The SOAP protocol is designed to be extensible, meaning you can add custom headers and functionalities to fit specific needs.

10. **Strict Messaging Protocol**: The rigid and explicit nature of SOAP messaging, including its use of XML for message format, ensures consistency and predictability in message exchanges.
