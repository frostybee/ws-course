In MySQL, the `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` keywords are used to control which subset of rows is returned by a `SELECT` query. These keywords are particularly useful for pagination, where you need to include a subset of rows from a larger dataset, typically in a in a REST API response with multiple pages of results. 

### 1. `LIMIT` Keyword

The `LIMIT` keyword is used to specify the maximum number of rows that the query should return. It can be used in **two forms**:

#### 1.1. `LIMIT number`

This form limits the result set to a specific number of rows from the beginning. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 10;
```

This query will return the first 10 rows from the `items` table.

#### 1.2. `LIMIT offset, number`

This form allows you to specify an offset and a limit. The offset determines the starting point (i.e., the number of rows to skip), and the number specifies the number of rows to return. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 20, 10;
```

In this query:
- `20` is the offset, so the query will skip the first 20 rows.
- `10` is the limit, so the query will return the next 10 rows, starting from row 21.

### 2. `OFFSET` Keyword

The `OFFSET` keyword is often used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to make the query more readable and flexible. It specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows.

The `OFFSET` keyword can be used in the following way:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

This is functionally equivalent to `LIMIT 20, 10`:

- `OFFSET 20` skips the first 20 rows.
- `LIMIT 10` returns the next 10 rows.

### Practical Example: Pagination

Pagination often combines `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to display results in pages. For instance, if you want to display results on pages with 10 items per page, you would calculate the **offset** based on the current page number.

Assuming you are on page 3, you would calculate the offset as follows:

- Items per page: 10
- Current page: 3
- **Offset** = (Current Page - 1) * Items per Page = (3 - 1) * 10 = 20

So, you would use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

This query would return the items for the 3rd page, showing rows 21 to 30.

<Aside type="tip" title="Summary">
- **`LIMIT`**: Specifies the maximum number of rows to return.
- **`OFFSET`**: Specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows.
- **`LIMIT number`**: Returns the first `number` rows.
- **`LIMIT offset, number`**: Skips `offset` rows and then returns `number` rows.
- **`LIMIT number OFFSET offset`**: Similar to `LIMIT offset, number`, specifying the number of rows to return and the offset in a more readable form.
