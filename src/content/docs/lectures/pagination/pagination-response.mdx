## How Pagination Works?

In a RESTful web service, pagination is typically implemented using query parameters to specify which subset of data should be returned. Here's how it generally works:

- **Request Parameters**: The client includes pagination parameters in the request URL. Common parameters are:
   - `page`: The page number to retrieve.
   - `limit` or `size`: The number of items per page.
   - `offset`: The number of items to skip before starting to collect the result set.

   For example, a GET request might look like this:
   ```bash
   GET /api/items?page=2&limit=10
   ```

- **Server Response**: The server responds with a subset of the data based on the requested page and limit. The response usually includes metadata to help the client understand the context of the data.

## Basic Paginated Response Structure

A well-structured paginated REST API response is crucial for efficient data handling and user experience. It typically includes both the **data** and **metadata** about the pagination.

The following is a general JSON structure of a ***paginated*** REST API response:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    /* Metadata about the pagination */
  },
  "data": [
    /* Array of items */
  ],
  "links": {
    /* Navigation links for pagination */
  }
}
```

### 1. **Metadata**

Metadata in a paginated response typically includes information about the pagination state and other relevant details about the dataset that help client applications **navigate** and **understand** the paginated data.

 Properly handling and including this metadata are important for creating a user-friendly and efficient API experience.

:::note
This **metadata** is often included in the response body alongside the paginated data itself or as part of the **response payload**.
:::

The **`meta`** field in the response provides typically includes:

- **`total`**: The total number of items available in the dataset (not limited by the current page size), regardless of the pagination. This helps clients understand the full scope of data available.
- **`total_pages`**: The total number of pages available, calculated based on the total count and page size. This helps clients understand how many pages they might need to navigate through.
- **`current_page`**: The current page number or index of the data being returned. This helps clients keep track of which page they are viewing.
- **`page_size`**: The number of items per page, which tells clients how many items are included in each page of the response.

    ```json title="Example of an offset-based pagination metadata:"
    {
    "meta": {
        "total": 100,
        "total_pages": 10,
        "current_page": 1,
        "page_size": 10
    }
    }
  ```

### 2. **Data**

The **`data`** field contains the actual list of items returned by the REST API. This is usually an array of objects representing the resources.


```json title="Example of paginated data:"
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Item 1",
      "details": "Some details about item 1"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Item 2",
      "details": "Some details about item 2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Links**

The **`links`** field contains navigation links to facilitate moving between pages. Common links include:

- **`self`**: The URI of the current page.
- **`next`**: A URI of the next page of results, if there are more pages available. This allows clients to easily fetch the subsequent set of data.
- **`prev`**: A URI of the previous page of results (if applicable). This allows clients to navigate back through the paginated data.
- **`first`**: A URI of the first page of results, providing a quick way to jump back to the beginning.
- **`last`**: A URI of the last page of results, giving clients a quick way to jump to the end of the dataset.


```json title="Example of links information in a paginated response:"
{
  "links": {
    "self": "https://api.example.com/items?page=1",
    "next": "https://api.example.com/items?page=2",
    "prev": null,
    "first": "https://api.example.com/items?page=1",
    "last": "https://api.example.com/items?page=10"
  }
}
```

### Example of a Well-Structured Paginated Response


```json title="Combining all the elements, a complete paginated response might look like this:"
{
  "meta": {
    "total": 100,
    "total_pages": 10,
    "current_page": 1,
    "page_size": 10
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Item 1",
      "details": "Some details about item 1"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Item 2",
      "details": "Some details about item 2"
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "self": "https://api.example.com/items?page=1",
    "next": "https://api.example.com/items?page=2",
    "prev": null,
    "first": "https://api.example.com/items?page=1",
    "last": "https://api.example.com/items?page=10"
  }
}
```

## Additional Metadata in the Paginated Response

Here are some common **types of metadata** that might be included in a paginated response:

- **Links**: A collection of hyperlinks to various pages in the dataset, often using a standardized format like <LinkOut href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc5988'>[RFC 5988]</LinkOut> (Web Linking).
-  **Sort information**: Details about how the data is sorted (e.g., by date, name, etc.), which can be useful if the sorting criteria might impact the pagination.
-  **Filter information**: Details about any filters applied to the data, which can provide context for the current paginated view.
-  **Query parameters**: Information on the query parameters used to generate the current paginated response, allowing clients to replicate or adjust the request if needed.

## **Key Considerations and Best Practices**

- **Consistency**: Ensure that the structure of your pagination response is consistent across different endpoints and versions of your API.
- **Provide metadata**: Always include metadata in responses to help clients understand the pagination state.
- **Clear documentation**: Provide clear documentation on how to use pagination parameters and what each one does.
- **Flexibility**: Support various pagination strategies, such as offset-based and cursor-based pagination, depending on your use case.
- **Performance**: For large datasets, optimize the query performance and consider caching strategies to improve response times.
- **Error handling**: Include proper error handling in your API. For instance, if a requested page exceeds the total number of pages, return a 404 or 400 status code with a clear error message.
