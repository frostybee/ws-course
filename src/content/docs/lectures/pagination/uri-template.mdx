## What Are URI Templates?

- A **URI template** ([RFC 6570](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570)) is a standardized way to define a pattern for a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), allowing for **flexible** and **reusable** URIs with variable parts that can be **substituted** dynamically. It can be considered as a "blueprint" for building URIs.

- A URI template specifies a **general structure** for a URI, using **placeholders** or **variable segments** that can be filled in with **actual values** to form complete URIs. 

- These placeholders are often **denoted** by **curly braces** `{}`, and they can represent path parameters, query parameters, or even portions of the domain.

:::tip
**URI template** is a useful concept in web services and REST API design to define paths that **can be adapted** based on different inputs.

### Example:
Here's a simple example of a URI template:

```
https://api.example.com/users/{userId}/posts/{postId}
```
**In this case:**
- `{userId}` and `{postId}` are **placeholders** for dynamic values.
- You can replace `{userId}` with an actual user ID (e.g., `123`) and `{postId}` with a specific post ID (e.g., `456`), resulting in a final URI like:

```
https://api.example.com/users/123/posts/456
```

## Features of URI Templates:
- **Placeholders**: Variables wrapped in curly braces (`{}`) that will be replaced with actual values.
- **Syntax rules**: URI templates can define how the variables should be encoded (e.g., slashes, query strings).
- **Flexible matching**: Templates can allow for optional segments, repeated segments, and more complex structures.

## Common Use Cases:
- **API Design**: Often used in RESTful APIs to specify endpoints where certain parts of the URI can be replaced with parameters.
- **URL generation**: Templates allow for the dynamic generation of URLs in web applications, for example, creating links to user profiles, search results, or specific resources.
