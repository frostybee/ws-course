## What Is PHP PDO?

:::note
- PHP **PDO** (PHP Data Objects) is a **database access layer** that provides a consistent interface for accessing **various types** of databases in PHP. 
- It provides a more modern, flexible approach, and secure approach for interacting with databases compared to older methods, such as `mysql_*` functions.

### Key Features of PDO:

1. **Database-agnostic**: PDO allows you to interact with many types of databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MSSQL, etc.) using the same API. This makes it easier to switch between different database systems without having to rewrite your queries.   
2. **Prepared statements**: PDO supports **prepared statements**, which help prevent SQL injection attacks by separating SQL code from user input. Prepared statements also allow for more efficient queries because the database can optimize them ahead of time.
3. **Error handling**: PDO provides various error modes, allowing you to control how errors are handled. You can set it to silently ignore errors, throw exceptions, or handle them in other ways.
4. **Transactions**: PDO makes it easy to implement transactions in your code, allowing you to perform multiple database operations that either all succeed or all fail.
5. **Binding parameters**: PDO allows for binding parameters in queries, which improves both security (by preventing SQL injection) and performance (by allowing query reuse).

## What Are Prepared Statements?

- [Prepared statements](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepare.php) in **PDO** (PHP Data Objects) are a feature that allows you to execute SQL queries **securely** and **efficiently** by separating the **query structure** from the **actual data** being inserted or retrieved. 
- This approach helps prevent **SQL injection attacks** and **improves performance**, especially when the same query is executed multiple times with different values.

## How Prepared Statements Works?



### 1. Preparation Phase:
   - An SQL **query template** is created, but without the **actual data** values.
   - The statement template can contain **zero or more** named ***placeholders*** (**`:name`**) (also called *bind parameters*)  or question mark (?) parameter markers for which real values will be **substituted** when the statement is executed.   
   - The database engine prepares the query, checks its structure, and optimizes it for execution.

### 2. Binding Parameters:
   - The placeholders are later bound to actual values, either through named parameters (e.g., `:name`) or positional placeholders (e.g., `?`).
   - The values are sent separately, preventing any harmful code from being executed.

### 3. Execution Phase:
   - Once the query is prepared and the parameters are bound, the query can be executed with the actual data.
   - The database executes the query, ensuring that the input data is safely handled.

## Example of Using Prepared Statements in PDO:

```php
// Step 1: Establish a PDO connection
$pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test", "username", "password");

// Step 2: Prepare the SQL query with placeholders
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email AND age = :age";
$stmt = $pdo->prepare($query);

// Step 3: Bind actual values to the placeholders
$email = "user@example.com";
$age = 30;
$stmt->bindParam(':email', $email);
$stmt->bindParam(':age', $age);

// Step 4: Execute the query
$stmt->execute();

// Step 5: Fetch the results
$results = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
foreach ($results as $row) {
    echo $row['name'] . "<br>";
}
```

## Benefits of Prepared Statements:
1. **Protection from SQL injection:** Input values are not directly inserted into the query, so malicious SQL code can't manipulate the query structure.
2. **Improved performance:** The database can reuse the query plan, making repeated executions faster when the same query is run multiple times with different parameters.
3. **Readability and maintainability:** Code is cleaner and easier to manage when using placeholders instead of embedding raw data directly in SQL strings.
4. **Flexibility:** You can use named placeholders (e.g., `:email`) or positional placeholders (`?`), making it easier to organize and manage complex queries.
