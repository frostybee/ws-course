This guide will cover the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) in PHP, including defining classes, creating objects, and utilizing key OOP concepts.
:::

### 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP

Object-oriented programming is a paradigm that organizes code into "objects," which can contain both data (properties) and functions (methods). OOP helps to structure your code in a modular, reusable, and maintainable way.

### 2. Defining a Class

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties and methods that the objects created from the class will have.

```php
class Car {
    // Properties
    private $make;
    private $model;
    private $year;

    // Constructor method
    public function __construct($make, $model, $year) {
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->model = $model;
        $this->year = $year;
    }

    // Method
    public function startEngine() {
        return "The engine of the $this->make $this->model is starting.";
    }
}
```

### 3. Creating Objects

An object is an instance of a class. You create an object using the `new` keyword.

```php
// Creating an object of the Car class
$myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);

// Accessing properties
echo $myCar->make; // Outputs: Toyota

// Calling a method
echo $myCar->startEngine(); // Outputs: The engine of the Toyota Corolla is starting.
```

### 4. Visibility Modifiers

Properties and methods in a class can have visibility modifiers which control their access:

- **`public`**: Accessible from everywhere.
- **`protected`**: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
- **`private`**: Accessible only within the class.

```php
class Person {
    public $name;
    protected $age;
    private $socialSecurityNumber;

    public function __construct($name, $age, $ssn) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
        $this->socialSecurityNumber = $ssn;
    }

    public function getAge() {
        return $this->age;
    }

    private function getSSN() {
        return $this->socialSecurityNumber;
    }
}
```

### 5. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to use properties and methods of another class. The new class is called a subclass, and the existing class is called a superclass.

```php
class ElectricCar extends Car {
    public $batteryCapacity;

    public function __construct($make, $model, $year, $batteryCapacity) {
        parent::__construct($make, $model, $year); // Call the parent constructor
        $this->batteryCapacity = $batteryCapacity;
    }

    public function charge() {
        return "Charging the $this->make $this->model with a battery capacity of $this->batteryCapacity kWh.";
    }
}

$myElectricCar = new ElectricCar("Tesla", "Model S", 2023, 100);
echo $myElectricCar->charge(); // Outputs: Charging the Tesla Model S with a battery capacity of 100 kWh.
```

### 6. Method Overriding

A subclass can override methods from the superclass to provide a specific implementation.

```php
class Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Some generic animal sound.";
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Woof!";
    }
}

$dog = new Dog();
echo $dog->makeSound(); // Outputs: Woof!
```

### 7. Accessing Parent Class Methods

A subclass can access methods from the parent class using the `parent` keyword.

```php
class Bird extends Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return parent::makeSound() . " Chirp!";
    }
}

$bird = new Bird();
echo $bird->makeSound(); // Outputs: Some generic animal sound. Chirp!
```

### 8. Static Properties and Methods

Static properties and methods belong to the class rather than any instance of the class. They are accessed using the `::` operator.

```php
class Math {
    public static $pi = 3.14;

    public static function add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }
}

echo Math::$pi; // Outputs: 3.14
echo Math::add(5, 10); // Outputs: 15
```

### 9. Abstract Classes

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. They are used to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

```php
abstract class Shape {
    abstract public function area();
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public $width;
    public $height;

    public function __construct($width, $height) {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }

    public function area() {
        return $this->width * $this->height;
    }
}

$rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 5);
echo $rectangle->area(); // Outputs: 50
```

### 10. Interfaces

Interfaces define methods that implementing classes must provide. They do not contain any implementation.

```php
interface Drivable {
    public function drive();
}

class Car implements Drivable {
    public function drive() {
        return "Driving the car.";
    }
}

$car = new Car();
echo $car->drive(); // Outputs: Driving the car.
```

### 11. Magic Methods

PHP has several magic methods that are automatically called in certain situations.

- **`__construct()`**: Constructor method called when an object is created.
- **`__destruct()`**: Destructor method called when an object is destroyed.
- **`__get($name)`**: Called when reading inaccessible properties.
- **`__set($name, $value)`**: Called when writing to inaccessible properties.
- **`__call($name, $arguments)`**: Called when invoking inaccessible methods.
- **`__toString()`**: Called when an object is treated as a string.

```php
class Person {
    private $data = array();

    public function __construct($name) {
        $this->data['name'] = $name;
    }

    public function __get($name) {
        return isset($this->data[$name]) ? $this->data[$name] : null;
    }

    public function __set($name, $value) {
        $this->data[$name] = $value;
    }

    public function __toString() {
        return "Person: " . $this->data['name'];
    }
}

$person = new Person("Alice");
echo $person->name; // Outputs: Alice
$person->age = 30;
echo $person; // Outputs: Person: Alice
```

### 12. Namespaces

Namespaces help to avoid name conflicts by grouping logically related classes, functions, and constants.

```php
namespace Vehicles;

class Car {
    public function start() {
        return "Car is starting.";
    }
}

// Usage
$car = new \Vehicles\Car();
echo $car->start(); // Outputs: Car is starting.
```
